# YouTube Video Downloader

This is a simple video downloader in which the user will input the link of the YouTube video they would like to download. Make sure pytube3 has been installed in the computer first via pip install.

Be sure to update the #SAVE_PATH# as well to whatever location you would like the video to save!

Thank you.
